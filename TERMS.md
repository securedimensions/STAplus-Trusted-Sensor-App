# STAplus Trusted Sensor Application Terms of Use

## Purpose of the Application
This application was developed as part of the EU [CitiObs](https://citiobs.eu/) project to support collaborative Citizen Science.

As a proof of concept, this application ensures user authenticity by enforcing a user login when starting the application. Uploading sensor readings to an access control enabled [OGC STAplus](https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-022r1/22-022r1.html) compliant endpoint ensures lineage from the sensor reading to the original uploading user. This is one important aspect to establish trust in Citizen Science data.
